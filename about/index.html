  <h1>{{ page.title }}</h1>
    <p>I’m a research assistant on the Global Health & Development team at <a href = "https://rethinkpriorities.org/">Rethink Priorities</a>, an <a href = "https://effectivealtruism.org">effective altruist</a> research organization. I also copyedit <a href = "http://asteriskmag.com/"><em>Asterisk</em></a>, a quarterly magazine about <a href = "https://theprecipice.com/">existential risk</a>. And I <a href="https://www.givingwhatwecan.org/pledge">donate 10% of my income</a> to the most effective charities. (If any of this sounds unfamiliar but interesting, maybe check out <a href = "https://80000hours.org/">80,000 Hours</a>, an Oxford-based organization that offers free career advising.)</p>
    <p>I recently graduated from the University of Chicago, where I majored in environmental science. Environmental science is housed in the geosciences department at UChicago, so I got to do cool stuff like research lead pollution <em>and</em> do a thesis on the orbital history of Mars. My transcript includes quite a bit of history, some computer science, and a sprinkling of classical Chinese, in addition to the <a href = "https://college.uchicago.edu/academics/core-curriculum">Core Curriculum</a>. I chose America for college because I wanted a <a href = "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liberal_arts_education">liberal arts education</a>.</p>
    <p>In 1999 I was born in London, England, to Chinese academics. We moved (back) to China in 2007, where I lived until age 18. We lived in Chengdu, a cloudy city in the South West known for its pandas and peppercorns. Journalism occupied most of my time in high school; I founded and edited a bilingual student magazine for three years and briefly dreamed of being a magazine editor when I grew up.</p>
    <p>As of 2022 I live in London, again, with my partner Puyu, who’s doing a master’s at University College London and who took the photo of me at Loch Ness. I like national parks, board games, maps, and most things that are sufficiently spicy. I recommend listening to <em><a href = "https://bloggingheads.tv/programs/wrightshow">Robert Wright’s Nonzero</a></em> (formerly <em>The Wright Show</em>) and <em><a href = "https://www.verybadwizards.com/">Very Bad Wizards</a></em>.</p>
