  <p>I’m starting a new job that involves reviewing literature, analysing data, and writing up reports on population health, international development, and climate change policies and interventions at <a><href = "https://rethinkpriorities.org/">Rethink Priorities</a>, an <a><href = "https://www.effectivealtruism.org">effective altruist</a> research organization. I also copyedit <a><href = "http://asteriskmag.com/"><em>Asterisk</em></a>, a quarterly magazine about <a href = "https://theprecipice.com/">existential risk</a>. If any of this sounds unfamiliar but interesting, maybe check out <a href = "https://80000hours.org/">80,000 Hours</a>.</p>
  <p>I recently graduated from the University of Chicago, where I majored in environmental science. Environmental science is housed in the geosciences department at UChicago, so I got to do cool stuff like spend time in Woods Hole, Massachusetts, researching lead pollution <em>and</em> do an optional thesis on the history of Mars’s orbit. I also did some history, some computer science, and some classical Chinese, in addition to the Core Curriculum. I went to college in America because I felt it was important to get a <a href = "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liberal_arts_education">liberal arts education</a>.</p>
  <p>In 1999, was born in London, England, to Chinese academics. My mum’s an academic psychiatrist who specializes in schizophrenia, and while I don’t really know what my dad researches I do know he’s a chemist-turned-physicist-turned-biologist. I was raised by my <em>waipo</em> or maternal grandma (1942–2022), who lived through Japanese air raids on Chungking, the Cultural Revolution, the post-Deng economic miracle, and Covid-19 lockdowns.</p>
  <p>So much of my time was spent rewatching BBC science and nature documentaries, rereading Roald Dahl’s children’s corpus, and flipping forwards and backwards through a dilapidated copy of the <em>Usborne Children’s Encyclopedia</em>. My family moved back to China in 2007, where I had most of my formative experiences. We lived in Chengdu, a cloudy city with pandas and mouth-numbing peppercorns, where I went to international school. I was into journalism in high school, where I founded and edited a bilingual student magazine for three years and briefly considered being a magazine editor when I grew up.</p>
  <p>As of 2022, I live in London with my partner Puyu, who’s doing a master’s degree at UCL. I like national parks, board games, and spicy food. I use en-GB-oxendict (which means I write “analyse” but “synthesize”, prefer my en-dashes spaced – like so – and my commas “untucked”, and always use the serial comma) and can appreciate a good <em>haiku</em>. I’ve also <a href="https://www.givingwhatwecan.org/pledge">pledged</a> to donate 10% of my income to the most effective charities for the rest of my life or until I retire.</p>
  <p>Here’s a photo Puyu took of me in front of Loch Ness when we fled the capital for cooler climes during the 2022 <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2022_United_Kingdom_heat_wave">heat wave</a>.</p>
