  <h1>{{ page.title }}</h1>
    <p>As a research assistant, I review literature, analyse data, and write reports on population health, international development, and climate change policies and interventions at <a href = "https://rethinkpriorities.org/">Rethink Priorities</a>, an <a href = "https://effectivealtruism.org">effective altruist</a> research organization. I also copyedit <a href = "http://asteriskmag.com/"><em>Asterisk</em></a>, a quarterly magazine about <a href = "https://theprecipice.com/">existential risk</a>. I’ve <a href="https://www.givingwhatwecan.org/pledge">pledged</a> to donate 10% of my income to the most effective charities.</p>
    <p>I grew up in London then Chengdu, in southwestern China. I chose America for college because I wanted a <a href = "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liberal_arts_education">liberal arts education</a>. From 2018 to 2022, I attended the University of Chicago, where I majored in environmental science. Environmental science is housed in the geosciences department at UChicago, so I got to <a href = "../projects/mbl_ses_report.pdf">research lead pollution in Massachusetts</a> <em>and</em> <a href = "../projects/uchicago_bs_thesis.pdf">do a thesis on the orbital history of Mars</a>. My transcript also includes quite a bit of history, some computer science, and a sprinkling of classical Chinese, in addition to the <a href = "https://college.uchicago.edu/academics/core-curriculum">Core Curriculum</a>.</p>
    <p>As of 2022, I’m living in London, again, with my partner Puyu, who’s doing a master’s at University College London and who took the <a href = "../">photo</a> of me at Loch Ness. I like exploring national parks, playing board games, looking at maps, riding trains, and adding chili oil to my food. I recommend <em><a href = "https://bloggingheads.tv/programs/wrightshow">Robert Wright’s Nonzero</a></em> (formerly <em>The Wright Show</em>), <em><a href = "https://www.verybadwizards.com/">Very Bad Wizards</a></em>, and <em><a href = "https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCbbQalJ4OaC0oQ0AqRaOJ9g">Map Men</a></em>.</p>
