    <p>Here’s a photo of me in front of Loch Ness when I fled the capital for cooler climes during the 2022 <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2022_United_Kingdom_heat_wave">heat wave</a>.</p>

    <p>I’m a research assistant on the Global Health & Development team at <a href = "https://rethinkpriorities.org/">Rethink Priorities</a>, an <a href = "https://www.effectivealtruism.org">effective altruist</a> research organization. I also copyedit <a href = "http://asteriskmag.com/"><em>Asterisk</em></a>, a quarterly magazine about <a href = "https://theprecipice.com/">existential risk</a>. And I <a href="https://www.givingwhatwecan.org/pledge">donate 10% of my income</a> to the most effective charities. If any of this sounds unfamiliar but interesting, maybe check out <a href = "https://80000hours.org/">80,000 Hours</a>.</p>
    <p>I recently graduated from the University of Chicago, where I majored in environmental science. Environmental science is housed in the geosciences department at UChicago, so I got to do cool stuff like research lead pollution <em>and</em> do a thesis on the orbital history of Mars. My transcript includes quite a bit of history, some computer science, and a sprinkling of classical Chinese, in addition to the <a href = "https://college.uchicago.edu/academics/core-curriculum">Core Curriculum</a>. I went to college in America because I felt it was important to get a <a href = "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liberal_arts_education">liberal arts education</a>.</p>
    <p>In 1999 I was born in London, England, to Chinese academics. My mum’s an academic psychiatrist who specializes in schizophrenia, and while I don’t really know what my dad researches I do know he’s a chemist-turned-physicist-turned-biologist. I was raised by my <em>waipo</em> or maternal grandma (1942–2022), who was a primary school teacher and had the best Sichuan chili oil recipe.</p>
    <p>My family moved back to China in 2007, where I had most of my formative experiences. We lived in Chengdu, a cloudy city in the South West known for its pandas and peppercorns, where I went to international school. Journalism occupied most of my time in high school; I founded and edited a bilingual student magazine for three years and briefly dreamed of being a magazine editor when I grew up.</p>
    <p>As of 2022 I live in London with my partner Puyu, who’s doing a master’s at UCL. I like national parks, board games, and spicy food. I use en-GB-oxendict (which means I write “analyse” but “synthesize”, prefer my en-dashes spaced – like so – and my commas “untucked”, and always use the serial comma) and appreciate a good <em>haiku</em>.</p>
