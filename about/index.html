    <p>As a research assistant, I review literature, analyse data, and write reports on global health, international development, and climate change causes and interventions at <a href = "https://rethinkpriorities.org/">Rethink Priorities</a>, an <a href = "https://effectivealtruism.org">effective altruism</a>–associated research organization. I also copyedit <a href = "http://asteriskmag.com/"><em>Asterisk</em></a>, a quarterly magazine about <a href = "https://theprecipice.com/">existential risk</a> and am a bilingual communications and strategy affiliate at <a href = "https://tian-xia.com/">天下 Tianxia</a>.</p>
    <p>I recently graduated <em>summa cum laude</em> from the University of Chicago with a bachelor’s degree in environmental science with honors. I conducted research projects on planets and pollution, and studied (abroad) at the University of Chicago Yuen campus in Mount Davis, Hong Kong, and (away) at the Marine Biological Laboratory in Woods Hole, Massachusetts.</p>
