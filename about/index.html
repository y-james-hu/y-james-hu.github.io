  <h1>{{ page.title }}</h1>
    <p>I research topics in global health, international development, and climate change at <a href="https://rethinkpriorities.org/">Rethink Priorities</a>, a consultancy and think tank affiliated with the effective altruism movement. In practice, my team has focused on cause- and intervention-level analyses commissioned by charitable foundations and individual philanthropists.</p>
    <p>I also offer English copy-editing services in line with <a href="https://www.ciep.uk/resources/suggested-minimum-rates/">rates</a> set by the Chartered Institute of Editing and Proofreading of the United Kingdom. Please send me a message <a href="../contact">here</a> if you’d like to work together.</p>
    <p>While I’m primarily based in London, I’ve also studied and worked in the United States and China. In 2022, I graduated <em>summa cum laude</em> and Phi Beta Kappa from the University of Chicago, with a bachelor of science in environmental science with honors.</p>
