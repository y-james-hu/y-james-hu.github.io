  <h1>{{ page.title }}</h1>
    <p>I review literature, analyse data, and write reports on global health, international development, and climate change causes and interventions at <a href = "https://rethinkpriorities.org/">Rethink Priorities</a>, an <a href = "https://effectivealtruism.org">effective altruism</a>–associated research organization, where I'm a research assistant. I also copyedit <a href = "http://asteriskmag.com/"><em>Asterisk</em></a>, a quarterly magazine about <a href = "https://theprecipice.com/">existential risk</a> and serve as a bilingual communications and strategy affiliate at <a href = "https://tian-xia.com/">天下 Tianxia</a>, a community organization based in Beijing.</p>
    <p>I recently graduated from the University of Chicago with a major in environmental science, but I also studied partway through the history and East Asian languages and civilization majors. I conducted research projects on planets and pollution, and studied (abroad) at the University of Chicago Yuen campus in Mount Davis, Hong Kong, and (away) at the Marine Biological Laboratory in Woods Hole, Massachusetts.</p>
