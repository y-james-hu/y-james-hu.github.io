  <h1>{{ page.title }}</h1>
    <p>I review literature, analyse data, and write reports on global health, international development, and climate change causes and interventions at <a href = "https://rethinkpriorities.org/">Rethink Priorities</a>, an <a href = "https://effectivealtruism.org">effective altruist</a> research consultancy and think tank, where I’m an associate researcher. I also copyedit <a href = "http://asteriskmag.com/"><em>Asterisk</em></a>, a quarterly magazine about <a href = "https://theprecipice.com/">existential risk</a>, and serve as bilingual communications and strategy affiliate at <a href = "https://tian-xia.com/">天下 Tianxia</a>, a Beijing-based community organization.</p>
    <p>I recently graduated from the University of Chicago with a major in environmental science, but I also studied partway through the history and East Asian languages and civilizations majors. I conducted research projects on planets and pollution, and studied (abroad) at UChicago’s Yuen Campus in Mount Davis, Hong Kong, and (away) at the Marine Biological Laboratory in Woods Hole, Massachusetts.</p>
