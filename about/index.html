  <p>I review literature, analyse data, and write up reports on population health, international development, and climate change policies and interventions at <a><href = "https://rethinkpriorities.org/">Rethink Priorities</a>, an <a><href = "https://www.effectivealtruism.org">effective altruist</a> research organization. I also copyedit <a><href = "http://asteriskmag.com/"><em>Asterisk</em></a>, a quarterly magazine about existential risk.</p>
  <p>Effective altruism is a research field and social movement that tries to figure out the best ways to do good. We ask big questions and think we have preliminary answers to some of them. Some people focus on the long-term future; others focus on present-day sentient beings. Some people think it’s important to maximize wellbeing; others think it’s important to minimize suffering. Some people think it’s exciting that there’s so much good to be done; others think it’s a moral obligation to do the most good (for the record, I’m on the “excited” end of the spectrum). If this sounds interesting, maybe check out <a href="https://80000hours.org/">80,000 Hours</a>, an Oxford-based organization that offers free career advice.</p>
  <p>I majored in environmental science at the University of Chicago. Environmental science is housed in the geosciences department at UChicago, so I got to do cool stuff like spend time researching lead pollution at the Ecosystems Center of the Marine Biological Laboratory <em>and</em> do my optional undergraduate thesis on the history of Mars’s orbital obliquity with the department's planetary geoscience group. I also did some history, some computer science, and some classical Chinese, in addition to the Core Curriculum. I went to an American college because I felt it was important to get a <a href = "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liberal_arts_education">liberal arts education</a>.</p>
  <p>I was born in London, England, to Chinese academics. My mum’s an academic psychiatrist who studies schizophrenia, and I don’t really know what my dad researches but I do know he’s a chemist-turned-physicist-turned-biologist. I was raised by my <em>waipo</em> or maternal grandma (1942–2022), who lived through the Japanese air raids on Chungking, the Cultural Revolution, and a lot more.</p>
  <p>I remember spending a lot of my time on my own rewatching BBC science and nature documentaries, rereading Roald Dahl’s children’s corpus, and flipping forwards and backwards through a peeling-at-the-edges copy of the <em>Usborne Children’s Encyclopedia</em>. My family moved back to China in 2007, where I had most of my formative experiences. We lived in Chengdu, a cloudy city with pandas and mouth-numbing peppercorns, where I went to international school. I was into journalism in high school, where I founded and edited a bilingual student magazine for three years and briefly considered being a magazine editor when I grew up.</p>
  <p>As of 2022, I live in London with my partner Puyu, who’s doing a master’s degree at UCL. I like national parks, board games, and spicy food. I use en-GB-oxendict (which means I write “analyse” but “synthesize”, prefer my en-dashes spaced – like so – and my commas “untucked”, and always use the serial comma) and can appreciate a good <em>haiku</em>. I’ve also <a href="https://www.givingwhatwecan.org/pledge">pledged</a> to donate 10% of my income to the most effective charities for the rest of my life or until I retire.</p>
  <p>Here’s a photo Puyu took of me in front of Loch Ness when we fled the capital for cooler climes during the 2022 <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2022_United_Kingdom_heat_wave">heat wave</a>.</p>
