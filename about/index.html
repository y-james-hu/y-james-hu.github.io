  <h1>{{ page.title }}</h1>
    <p>As a research assistant, I review literature, analyse data, and write reports on population health, international development, and climate change policies and interventions at <a href = "https://rethinkpriorities.org/">Rethink Priorities</a>, an <a href = "https://effectivealtruism.org">effective altruist</a> research organization. I also copyedit <a href = "http://asteriskmag.com/"><em>Asterisk</em></a>, a quarterly magazine about <a href = "https://theprecipice.com/">existential risk</a>.</p>
    <p>I recently graduated <em>summa cum laude</em> from the University of Chicago with a bachelor’s degree in environmental science with honors. I conducted planetary geoscience and ecosystem pollution research projects, helmed <em>The Chicago Maroon</em>’s copy desk for two years, and studied (abroad) at the University of Chicago Yuen campus in Mount Davis, Hong Kong, and (away) at the Marine Biological Laboratory in Woods Hole, Massachusetts.</p>
