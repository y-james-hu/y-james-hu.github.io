  <h1>{{ page.title }}</h1>
    <p>I review literature, analyse data, and write reports on global health, international development, and climate change causes and interventions at <a href = "https://rethinkpriorities.org/">Rethink Priorities</a>, an <a href = "https://effectivealtruism.org">effective altruist</a> research consultancy and think tank, where I’m a research assistant. I also copyedit <a href = "http://asteriskmag.com/"><em>Asterisk</em></a>, a quarterly magazine about <a href = "https://theprecipice.com/">existential risk</a>, and serve as a bilingual communications and strategy affiliate at <a href = "https://tian-xia.com/">天下 Tianxia</a>, a Beijing-based community organization.</p>
    <p>I recently graduated from the University of Chicago with a major in environmental science (foci: biogeochemistry, ecology, surface geology, aquatic and terrestrial fieldwork, and ecosystem modelling), but I also studied partway through the history (focus: critical theory) and East Asian languages and civilization (foci: literary Chinese, contemporary Asia) majors. I conducted research projects on planets and pollution, and studied (abroad) at the University of Chicago Yuen campus in Mount Davis, Hong Kong, and (away) at the Marine Biological Laboratory in Woods Hole, Massachusetts.</p>
