  <h1>{{ page.title }}</h1>
    <p>As a research assistant, I review literature, analyse data, and write reports on population health, international development, and climate change policies and interventions at <a href = "https://rethinkpriorities.org/">Rethink Priorities</a>, an <a href = "https://effectivealtruism.org">effective altruist</a> research organization. I also copyedit <a href = "http://asteriskmag.com/"><em>Asterisk</em></a>, a quarterly magazine about <a href = "https://theprecipice.com/">existential risk</a>.</p>
    <p>I recently graduated <em>summa cum laude</em> from the University of Chicago with a bachelor of science in environmental science with honors. I conducted planetary science and ecosystem pollution research projects, helmed <em>The Chicago Maroon</em>'s copy desk for two years, and studied abroad in Hong Kong and at the Marine Biological Laboratory.</p>
