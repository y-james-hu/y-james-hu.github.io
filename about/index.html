  <h1>{{ page.title }}</h1>
    <p>I review literature, analyse data, and write reports on global health, international development, and climate change causes and interventions at <a href = "https://rethinkpriorities.org/">Rethink Priorities</a>, a research consultancy and think tank, where Iâ€™m an associate researcher. I also freelance as a copy editor (en) and bilingual communications consultant (en, zh).</p>
    <p>I recently graduated from the University of Chicago with a major in environmental science, but I also studied partway through the history and East Asian languages and civilizations majors. I conducted research projects on planets and pollution, and spent time in external academic programmes in Hong Kong (Human Rights in Asia) and Woods Hole, Massachusetts (Semester in Environmental Science).</p>
